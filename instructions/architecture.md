# PKM Chatbot Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a personal knowledge management (PKM) chatbot that provides a chat interface to interact with my entire markdown-based knowledge management system from anywhere.

## Selected Approach: Hybrid Local/Cloud Architecture

After evaluating multiple options, I've decided on a **Hybrid Local/Cloud Architecture** that balances privacy, accessibility, performance, and maintenance requirements.

## Architecture Components

1. **Local Processing Pipeline**

   - Processes markdown files (~4500 files + assets) from my local system
   - Generates vector embeddings using NLP models (e.g., sentence-transformers)
   - Runs automatically when new content is synced to GitLab

2. **Cloud Vector Database (Pinecone)**

   - Stores embeddings in Pinecone, a specialized vector database
   - Enables fast semantic search capabilities
   - Maintains separation from the raw content for additional privacy

3. **Web Service (Vercel)**

   - Next.js application hosted on Vercel
   - Simple chat interface accessible from any device
   - Connects to Pinecone for relevant document retrieval
   - Integrates with an LLM API (Claude or GPT-4) for processing queries
   - Uses Vercel KV for chat history and session storage
   - Includes authentication to ensure only I can access the system

4. **Synchronization Mechanism**
   - Monitors GitLab repository for changes
   - Updates embeddings when new content is pushed
   - Maintains consistency between local files and searchable content

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Privacy**: Keeps most processing local while enabling remote access
- **Accessibility**: Provides access from anywhere
- **Flexibility**: Works with different LLM options as technologies evolve
- **Maintainability**: Reasonable balance between features and complexity
- **Leverages Existing Workflow**: Integrates with my current GitLab-based version control
- **Optimized Hosting**: Uses specialized services for their strengths (Vercel for Next.js, Pinecone for vectors)

## Implementation Phases

1. **Setup Local Embedding Pipeline**

   - Implement markdown parsing and processing
   - Select and integrate embedding model
   - Create efficient updating mechanism

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**

   - Configure Pinecone vector database
   - Set up Vercel hosting and Vercel KV
   - Implement secure authentication
   - Connect services together

3. **Web Interface Development**

   - Create responsive chat UI with Shadcn/ui
   - Implement context handling for conversations
   - Add search refinement capabilities
   - Utilize Vercel AI SDK for streaming responses

## Sample Query Flow

1. User asks: "Which recipes do I have involving eggplants?"
2. System retrieves relevant markdown files using vector similarity from Pinecone
3. Context from these files is combined with the user query
4. LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context
5. Response streams to the user interface via Vercel AI SDK
6. User receives an answer with references to specific notes
7. Conversation history is saved to Vercel KV for future reference
