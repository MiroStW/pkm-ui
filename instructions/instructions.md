# PKM Chatbot: Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for building the PKM Chatbot web interface. Each step includes a verifiable checkpoint to confirm successful implementation.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project

- Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and other dev dependencies
- Set up Tailwind CSS
- **Checkpoint**: Running `npm run dev` starts a development server without errors, and the base Next.js page loads correctly.

### Step 2: Configure Authentication

- Implement NextAuth.js with Supabase credential provider
- Create login/authentication pages
- Set up session management
- **Checkpoint**: Users can sign in with credentials and access protected routes, and are redirected to login when accessing protected routes without authentication.

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase for Data Storage

- Configure Supabase PostgreSQL for user and chat storage
- Create database schema for users, chat sessions, and messages
- Implement utility functions for interacting with Supabase
- Implement basic CRUD operations for chat sessions
- **Checkpoint**: Test commands can write to and read from Supabase PostgreSQL successfully.

### Step 4: Install Vercel AI SDK

- Install AI SDK and provider libraries (`npm install ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai`)
- Configure OpenAI API key in `.env.local`
- Create initial AI provider setup
- Set up embedding utilities in `lib/ai/embedding.ts`
- **Checkpoint**: AI SDK is correctly installed and can be imported in components.

## Phase 2: Core UI Components

### Step 5: Install UI Component Library

- Set up Shadcn/ui
- Configure theme and global styles
- Create basic layout components
- **Checkpoint**: Basic UI components render correctly with proper styling.

### Step 6: Build Chat Interface with AI SDK

- Implement `useChat` hook from AI SDK for managing chat state
- Create chat message component with markdown rendering
- Build chat container with message history display
- Implement chat input with send functionality
- **Checkpoint**: Chat interface displays messages, handles user input, and properly renders AI responses.

### Step 7: Create API Routes for AI

- Implement chat API endpoint using AI SDK's streaming capabilities
- Set up authentication middleware for API routes
- Create a route handler for the chat endpoint that uses the OpenAI provider
- **Checkpoint**: API routes correctly process messages and stream responses back to the client.

## Phase 3: Backend Integration

### Step 8: Implement Vector Database Integration

- Configure Pinecone client
- Create utility functions for querying the vector database
- Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
- **Checkpoint**: Vector search queries return relevant results from the Pinecone database.

### Step 9: Implement RAG with AI SDK

- Use AI SDK for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Create chunking and embedding functions
- Implement context management for conversations
- Connect vector search results to chat completion
- **Checkpoint**: LLM returns contextually relevant responses based on provided documents from the vector store.

### Step 10: Enhance Chat Experience

- Implement reasoning display capabilities
- Add streaming response visualization
- Create better error handling for AI responses
- **Checkpoint**: Chat provides a seamless experience with real-time streamed responses.

## Phase 4: Search and Filter Features

### Step 11: Add Search Refinement Features

- Implement date range filters
- Create tag/category filters
- Add search scope adjustments
- **Checkpoint**: Filters modify search results appropriately, and refined searches return more relevant results.

### Step 12: Implement Cross-Device Synchronization

- Leverage Supabase relational model for chat history with user associations
- Implement settings synchronization
- Create functionality to continue conversations across devices
- **Checkpoint**: Chat history is accessible across multiple devices and browsers for the same authenticated user.

## Phase 5: Polish and Optimization

### Step 13: Improve Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- Create user-friendly error messages
- **Checkpoint**: System gracefully handles errors without crashing, and provides helpful feedback to users.

### Step 14: Optimize Performance

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- **Checkpoint**: Lighthouse performance score exceeds 90, and key user interactions complete within acceptable time limits.

### Step 15: Add Final UI Polish

- Refine animations and transitions
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement dark/light mode toggle
- **Checkpoint**: UI is visually consistent across devices and screen sizes, with smooth transitions and a professional appearance.

## Phase 6: Deployment and Testing

### Step 16: Deploy to Vercel

- Configure production environment variables
- Set up continuous integration/deployment
- Implement staging environment for testing
- **Checkpoint**: Application is successfully deployed and accessible via a public URL.

### Step 17: Comprehensive Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components
- Implement end-to-end testing for key user flows
- Perform cross-browser compatibility testing
- **Checkpoint**: All tests pass, and the application functions correctly across different browsers and devices.

### Step 18: Documentation and Maintenance Plan

- Create comprehensive documentation for codebase
- Document API endpoints and usage
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- **Checkpoint**: Documentation is complete and accessible, and monitoring systems are in place to detect issues.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the PKM Chatbot web interface. By following these steps and verifying each checkpoint, you can ensure a successful implementation that meets all the requirements outlined in the architecture and web interface specifications.
